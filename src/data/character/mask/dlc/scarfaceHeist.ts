You unite the hard chill of the night with the dazzling radiance of the sun. Glorious, golden and beautiful, you shall turn their heads mad with desire - and it shall be their undoing.'

			'Timothy Miller dreamt of working with movie lightning when he grew up. For a Halloween-party, he created the Golden Hour mask. But when he put it on and looked in the mirror, his eyes stared back surrounded by the perfect soft, red glow of the sunset. In that moment, a new dream was born. He wanted people to view the serenity of the sunset close-up, wanted it imprinted on their retina forever. The only thing the coroner could confirm was that all victims were killed shortly before sunset, their eyes always left wide open.'

		description: [
			'The day Chad got the Barrori Flex sunglasses, everything changed. They gave him a brand new perspective on what’s important in life. Looking cool and blase became his purpose, his reason to live. With his Italian sports coat, beige linen pants and loafers he caught jealous looks and turned necks wherever he went. But it couldn’t last and when Chad’s beauty faded so did his will to live. He made a good-looking corpse, best clothes on, when he swallowed a whole can of diet pills.'

			'The rage of the tiger is legendary, and the king of the jungle will not be contained willingly. They may think they have you under control, but hell hath no fury like a caged tiger. As you break out, they will come to know this. Claws will rip and teeth will tear, flesh from bone, as you claim your kingdom.'
