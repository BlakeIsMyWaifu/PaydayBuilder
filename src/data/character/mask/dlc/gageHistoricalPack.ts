			'One of the bravest men I saw in the African campaign was on a telegraph pole in the midst of furious fire while we were moving toward Tunis. I stopped and asked him what the hell he was doing up there. He answered, \'Fixing the wire, sir.\' \'Isn\'t it a little unhealthy up there right now?\' I asked. \'Yes sir, but this goddamn wire has got to be fixed.\' I asked, \'Don\'t those planes strafing the road bother you?\' And he answered, \'No sir, but you sure as hell do.\'',
			'Now, there was a real soldier. A real man. A man who devoted all he had to his duty, no matter how great the odds, no matter how seemingly insignificant his duty appeared at the time.'

		description: [
			'For much between 1940-1969, the Constable was the dominant military and political leader of France. Refusing to accept his government\'s armistice with the German invaders in 1940, he set up his base in London, proclaimed himself the incarnation of France, and created the Free French movement. During the war he rallied the overseas colonies, especially those in Africa, organized the Resistance from abroad, and struggled to gain full recognition from the British and Americans.'

			'\'In Soviet Russia, Red Bear kills you.\' No one knows exactly who the Red Bear was; some say he was just a myth, a symbol of the motherland and everything that was strong, combined into one being. Only the stories are known and told again and again. Like that one time, when he killed a bunch of bears and came back home all in red, drenched in blood.'
