			'Being a Planetary Tomb Guardian is a lonely job. But a job that must be done. Eons of time float by without a single living organism in sight. Stars and suns brighten the day and night. But solitude is a horrid thing. But then one day, a spacecraft breaks the silence and you are not alone anymore. Someone is visiting this planet you call home.'
